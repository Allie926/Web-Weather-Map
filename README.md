# Web-Weather-Map

Web-based weather and location app made for Rich Media Web Development 1 with fellow RIT student Conor Lilley
Utilizes Google Maps API and OpenWeather Weather API

Allows the user to search for a location, find it on a map, and see current weather data
User has the ability to change units of weather data to their preferences

Weather data includes:
- Weather (sunny, cloudy, raining, etc.)
- Temperature (F, C, K)
- Wind speeds (m/s, km/hr, mph)

*Google Maps API key expired, causing the API to not function as intended anymore*
